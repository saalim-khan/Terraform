**File Destructure**
when we create complex infrastructure
when there is a concern of seperation
here what happen is 
we have created multiple folders 
seperately.

this is use when we are going to create multiple blocks

IMPORTANT:here the file is loading in alphabatical order



output:-

LENOVO@DESKTOP-1BI5I2K MINGW64 ~/OneDrive/Desktop/terraform/hello-world-file-destructure
$ terraform plan

Changes to Outputs:
  + abc    = "this is abc"
  + first  = "no 1"
  + second = "no 2"
  + third  = "no 3"

You can apply this plan to save these new output values to the Terraform state, without changing any real infrastructure.
